System Instability: Unofficial modifications to the software can lead to frequent crashes, corrupted project files, and a loss of valuable work.


No Updates or Support: You will not receive critical security patches, bug fixes, or new feature updates from the official developer, leaving you with an outdated and vulnerable application.


Legal Consequences: Using and distributing pirated software is a violation of copyright law and can lead to significant legal and financial penalties.
